# FOREWORD

Most of the best experiences in life come as surprises. Apart from being elected Master of Peterhouse, nothing has come as a greater surprise to me than to find myself President of the Peterhouse Boat Club. As a non-rowing man I have had a lot to learn. Among other things I have come to appreciate the truth of Professor Martin Plumleyâ€™s assertion at a recent Bumps Supper that there is nothing much wrong with a college when its boats are doing well. 

The Boat Club is a focus and gauge of college loyalty; and few bodies of men have a more vivid sense of history. It is entirely appropriate that the club should be celebrating its sesquicentenary at a time when the college is actively preparing for its Septcentenary.

One way of marking the passing of a milestone is to draw inspiration for the future from a contemplation of the past. Roland Mayer, himself an old member of the P.B.C. of notable dedication, has placed us all under a further debt by compiling the present history. The story he tells is one of many ups and downs. Recent years have witnessed a notable resurgence in the prowess of Peterhouse oarsmen. What is of even greater moment, to judge from past history, is the number of men coming forward to man the boats. Many more bumps stand between us and a climax worthy of 1984. With five crews the Club is well placed to repeat the triumphs of old.

The President
