## Appendix 5. Reaching even further towards our good beginning

![](/you_can_win_this/media/image24.jpeg)

Patrick Overy dug this out from the depths of "Ernie's shop." The Lent
crew of 1873.

Tim Ambrose's graphs show a rise of three places that year, after a
precipitous fall and before another descent, so they had something to be
proud of. Must have been a strange time -- low numbers, but enormous
science and math influence. Cookson was Master.

The relaxed poses; the wildly differing body languages; only one narrow
tie amongst wide variety and one cravat; only one single-breasted
jacket; different hats; the weird rudder on the ground in front of the
cox; one guy with shiny hair and shiny shoes. No club uniform back them.
All different characters, that's for sure, but they got together and
moved a boat with blue and white blades. The flag and mitre (all three
flags were still around in '56) Absolutely fascinating. Most looking
away from the camera -- probably one of those big boxes with a cloth
over it and a huge magnesium flare.

That's five or six generations ago. Wonder who they were and what
descendants they now have. Kelvin was at the height of his powers and
Darwin's thoughts were debated.
