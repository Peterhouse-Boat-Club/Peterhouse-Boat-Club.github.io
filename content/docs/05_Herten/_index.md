# A Few Notes for Future P.B.C Captains

BY

W . G. HERTEN

Captain, 1920-21.

I am writing these notes for the following reasons: The P.B.C. has put up some good shows in the past, but it has also put up some jolly bad ones, and unfortunately, at the time of writing, the latter outweigh the former.

I attribute this to two things: -

I. Lack of interest.

II. Bad captaining and coaching.

The former is the natural outcome of the latter.

The second is due to many causes. In-experience, slackness, no ambition and not knowing what to do, and it is because of this last reason that I am writing.

To start out, you may have heard people say: "Peterhouse is not a rowing college and never will be, we'll never do any good on the river, etc., etc." The answer to that is "ROT."

In 1842 we were Head of the River. This is a goodish while back, but it doesn't matter; there are only six colleges out of about 19 or 20 who can say that. Then you need only go into the "Sec" and look at the oars there. Thse successes come about once every 10 or 20 years. Why? Because a good crew sticks together for about three years. Then they all go down and a new man takes the captaincy, often inexperienced and doesn't know how to act. People will lose interest in the boat, and everything will go to blazes. This will go on until a fellow comes up who had made up his mind to set things humming.

The first thing you must impress upon yourself is that you have been entrusted with the welfare of the Boat Club, which, there-fore, comes before everything else, including yourself. If you do not engrave this on your mind, then chances to one you will make a mess of things. Act in such a manner, so that at the end you can say with a clear conscience: "I have done my best." Though you may sometimes feel fed up with everything (and this will occur pretty often), it will be a great satifaction to you to be avle to say that, when you have finished.

If the many who was captain before you had gone down, impress on those old May-colours who are still with you, and upon Freshers especially, the necessity for carry-ing on the good work. You have not been made captain because of your pretty eyes, so if you exert your personality, you will get people to follow you. Try and learn every blessed thing you can about rowing, as nothing looks so foolish as mades people lose confidence in you, as when a fellow asks you something during tubbing, and you do not know what to answer. A great deal can be gathered from books, keeping your eyes open and talking with people who know something about it. Get to know everything about our boats, our boathouse, the boat-man, etc., and see if there is room for any improvement; there generally is. If ever anything has to ve done (repairing etc.), see to it _yourself_ that it is done, and don't rely on other people.

I shall endeavour to outline the general programme for the year, which I don't think changes much. You have probably been elected at the end of the preceding May Term, and you enter office on the following academical year. If you have veen elected at any other time, you will have the ex-captain to help and advise you.

## MICHAELMAS TERM.

As soon as you can after term starts, put up a notice in the "Sex," to the effect that: "Those who wish to go in for rowing or coxing are requested to put down their names, weights and previous experience." Besides this, send another notice round Hall calling people's attention to it. You will find, howeverk that this is not enough, so you'll have to be after the men yourself. You will naturally come into conflict with the Rugger and Soccer captains, and as these two games are generally more popular you will have to "gang warily." Don't fight these men, make friends with them, and they will probably let you have more men than if you wage war on them.

A meeting is held avout the first or second week after term starts. After the usual reading of the minutes, etc., give a general idea of the year's programme, and a clear one of the term's. A financial meeting of the Amal. is also held about this time, at which you will have to present your estimate of expenses.

Your chief care should be to knock Fresher's into shape. Above all, spare no pains with heavy men; they take a good deal of teaching, but turn out the most useful in the end. You will have to work jolly hard, as _this term the basis for the Lents and Mays is laid._ Have as many Crock Eights out as you can, and give them a week strict training. Having many boats out will give you more people to choose from later and also creates greater competetition among the men. Row the Crock Eights race at the end of November.

Besides this, there are the Light Fours and the Colquhoun Sculls. If you have a boat for the former and have a good crew, have a shot at them. They are a great test of oarsmanship, and one learns a great deal. If you or anybody else is a sculler, go in the for the Colquhouns. You may not win, but it is good practice. In general, encourage sculling as much as possible. It makes one familiar with the "feel" and balancing of a boat.

If you are in the 'Varsity Trial Eights, tell your Secretary exactly what you want, and come and have a look at things as often as you can.

_Re_ trials, send in the names of men you would like to have tried to the Secretary C.U.B.C. If you think you have a change yourself, get your Secretary to send in the names.

A word as to Freshers who join the Boat Club. They are funny creatures, and generally consist of three varieties. Some are most extraordinarily casual. They generally have been demi-gods at school, and have rather a fine idea of themselves. These people want snubbing and sitting on, but carefully, as you don't want to lose them. Others are exuberant, making speeches, and think they know everything. Humour tgen abd talk to them in a fatherly manner; they generally turn out all right. The third sort are generally very few and far between, and are everything they should be. They are the best of the lot, but not numerous. If you are lucky enough to find any, freeze on to them.

I shall not enter into a treatise on coaching, as on this subject there is plenty to be read in books like "The Complete Oarsman," by Lehmann, and Dr. Warre's "Grammar of Rowing." Also "Notes on Bruce's Coaching," several copies of which are in the boathouse. But one of the most difficult things, and which I have never been able to read anything about, is, what exactly to say to a Fresher, who has never had an oar in his hand before. It's useless to set down a general rule. Most people start by giving a most tremendous hoik with their arms. It would be advisable to start out by showing them how to sit, hold the oar, keep a straight body, etc., and then impressing on them that the pulling is done by the body combined with a hard drive with the legs, and not with the arms, which might be comparable to two pieces of rope with iron hooks attached to the end, reaching from the shoulder to the oar. Looseness and freedom of movement should be talked about often. Once these things have been grasped, one can on to feet, strong position, etc. Be careful not to use too technical language. If you tell a man he is not turning off his feature, he will probably not know what you mean. Explain things to him carefully, and show him how it is probably due to his faulty wrist work i.e., not doing the turning with his inside hand, etc. The same with other faults, always trace them to their origin. This is important.

Hold meetings of your old May Colour coaches in your rooms, and tell them what to go for, thus ensuring a uniform style. Give each coach a copy of Bruce's Notes and Havilland's "Elements of Rowing," copies of which are to be kept in the boarhouse cupboard. The race, though a time race, should be rowed as much like a bumping race as possbile. Let them start 100 yards apart, and, if possible, have a three-minute, minute and starting gun. All the impedimenta, i.e., gungs, posts, etc., may be hired from the C.U.B.C., by applying to their boatman. The coack pots are bought at Munsey's, on Market Hill. If you have a crock supper, permission is necessary from the Tutor and the Steward, and be vareful that no damage is done to the college.

After the crocks, start forming the 1st Lent boat so as to have no trouble in starting at the beginning of the Lent Term. A few days before the end of term call a meteting, at which the officers resign and are generally re-elected. Impress on the first boat not to be too late in coming up, and remind the Hon. Treasurer of the Amal. to pay the boat's weekly wages through a bank.
