Captain, 1920-21.
I am writing these notes for the following reasons: The P.B.C. has put up some good shows in the past, but it has also put up some jolly bad ones, and unfortunately, at the time of writing, the latter outweigh the former."><meta name=theme-color content="#FFFFFF"><meta name=color-scheme content="light dark"><meta property="og:title" content="A Few Notes for Future P.B.C Captains"><meta property="og:description" content><meta property="og:type" content="website"><meta property="og:url" content="https://history.peterhousebc.org/docs/05_herten/"><title>A Few Notes for Future P.B.C Captains | The history of Peterhouse Boat Club</title><link rel=manifest href=/manifest.json><link rel=icon href=/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><link rel=stylesheet href=/book.min.c58292d36b18b675680ab9baea2029204537b839ea72f258746ec0f32ce8d6c8.css integrity="sha256-xYKS02sYtnVoCrm66iApIEU3uDnqcvJYdG7A8yzo1sg=" crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=/flexsearch.min.js></script>

<a class=anchor href=#a-few-notes-for-future-pbc-captains-1>#</a></h1><p>BY</p><p>W . G. HERTEN</p><p>Captain, 1920-21.</p><p>I am writing these notes for the following reasons: The P.B.C. has put up some good shows in the past, but it has also put up some jolly bad ones, and unfortunately, at the time of writing, the latter outweigh the former.</p><p>I attribute this to two things: -</p><p>I. Lack of interest.</p><p>II. Bad captaining and coaching.</p><p>The former is the natural outcome of the latter.</p><p>The second is due to many causes. In-experience, slackness, no ambition and not knowing what to do, and it is because of this last reason that I am writing.</p><p>To start out, you may have heard people say: &ldquo;Peterhouse is not a rowing college and never will be, we&rsquo;ll never do any good on the river, etc., etc.&rdquo; The answer to that is &ldquo;ROT.&rdquo;</p><p>In 1842 we were Head of the River. This is a goodish while back, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter; there are only six colleges out of about 19 or 20 who can say that. Then you need only go into the &ldquo;Sec&rdquo; and look at the oars there. Thse successes come about once every 10 or 20 years. Why? Because a good crew sticks together for about three years. Then they all go down and a new man takes the captaincy, often inexperienced and doesn&rsquo;t know how to act. People will lose interest in the boat, and everything will go to blazes. This will go on until a fellow comes up who had made up his mind to set things humming.</p><p>The first thing you must impress upon yourself is that you have been entrusted with the welfare of the Boat Club, which, there-fore, comes before everything else, including yourself. If you do not engrave this on your mind, then chances to one you will make a mess of things. Act in such a manner, so that at the end you can say with a clear conscience: &ldquo;I have done my best.&rdquo; Though you may sometimes feel fed up with everything (and this will occur pretty often), it will be a great satifaction to you to be avle to say that, when you have finished.</p><p>If the many who was captain before you had gone down, impress on those old May-colours who are still with you, and upon Freshers especially, the necessity for carry-ing on the good work. You have not been made captain because of your pretty eyes, so if you exert your personality, you will get people to follow you. Try and learn every blessed thing you can about rowing, as nothing looks so foolish as mades people lose confidence in you, as when a fellow asks you something during tubbing, and you do not know what to answer. A great deal can be gathered from books, keeping your eyes open and talking with people who know something about it. Get to know everything about our boats, our boathouse, the boat-man, etc., and see if there is room for any improvement; there generally is. If ever anything has to ve done (repairing etc.), see to it <em>yourself</em> that it is done, and don&rsquo;t rely on other people.</p><p>I shall endeavour to outline the general programme for the year, which I don&rsquo;t think changes much. You have probably been elected at the end of the preceding May Term, and you enter office on the following academical year. If you have veen elected at any other time, you will have the ex-captain to help and advise you.</p><h2 id=michaelmas-term>MICHAELMAS TERM
<a class=anchor href=#michaelmas-term>#</a></h2><p>As soon as you can after term starts, put up a notice in the &ldquo;Sex,&rdquo; to the effect that: &ldquo;Those who wish to go in for rowing or coxing are requested to put down their names, weights and previous experience.&rdquo; Besides this, send another notice round Hall calling people&rsquo;s attention to it. You will find, howeverk that this is not enough, so you&rsquo;ll have to be after the men yourself. You will naturally come into conflict with the Rugger and Soccer captains, and as these two games are generally more popular you will have to &ldquo;gang warily.&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t fight these men, make friends with them, and they will probably let you have more men than if you wage war on them.</p><p>A meeting is held avout the first or second week after term starts. After the usual reading of the minutes, etc., give a general idea of the year&rsquo;s programme, and a clear one of the term&rsquo;s. A financial meeting of the Amal. is also held about this time, at which you will have to present your estimate of expenses.</p><p>Your chief care should be to knock Fresher&rsquo;s into shape. Above all, spare no pains with heavy men; they take a good deal of teaching, but turn out the most useful in the end. You will have to work jolly hard, as <em>this term the basis for the Lents and Mays is laid.</em> Have as many Crock Eights out as you can, and give them a week strict training. Having many boats out will give you more people to choose from later and also creates greater competetition among the men. Row the Crock Eights race at the end of November.</p><p>Besides this, there are the Light Fours and the Colquhoun Sculls. If you have a boat for the former and have a good crew, have a shot at them. They are a great test of oarsmanship, and one learns a great deal. If you or anybody else is a sculler, go in the for the Colquhouns. You may not win, but it is good practice. In general, encourage sculling as much as possible. It makes one familiar with the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; and balancing of a boat.</p><p>If you are in the &lsquo;Varsity Trial Eights, tell your Secretary exactly what you want, and come and have a look at things as often as you can.</p><p><em>Re</em> trials, send in the names of men you would like to have tried to the Secretary C.U.B.C. If you think you have a change yourself, get your Secretary to send in the names.</p><p>A word as to Freshers who join the Boat Club. They are funny creatures, and generally consist of three varieties. Some are most extraordinarily casual. They generally have been demi-gods at school, and have rather a fine idea of themselves. These people want snubbing and sitting on, but carefully, as you don&rsquo;t want to lose them. Others are exuberant, making speeches, and think they know everything. Humour tgen abd talk to them in a fatherly manner; they generally turn out all right. The third sort are generally very few and far between, and are everything they should be. They are the best of the lot, but not numerous. If you are lucky enough to find any, freeze on to them.</p><p>I shall not enter into a treatise on coaching, as on this subject there is plenty to be read in books like &ldquo;The Complete Oarsman,&rdquo; by Lehmann, and Dr. Warre&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grammar of Rowing.&rdquo; Also &ldquo;Notes on Bruce&rsquo;s Coaching,&rdquo; several copies of which are in the boathouse. But one of the most difficult things, and which I have never been able to read anything about, is, what exactly to say to a Fresher, who has never had an oar in his hand before. It&rsquo;s useless to set down a general rule.</p><p>(Resume: Top of page 8)</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#michaelmas-term>MICHAELMAS TERM</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
