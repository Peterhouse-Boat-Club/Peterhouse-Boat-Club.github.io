On display were trophies for C.U.B.C. Clinker IVs, Fairbairn Junior
Sculls, Lowe Double Sculls, Bedford Junior Sculls, College Junior and
Senior Sculls, London Rowing Club Colleges Regatta, and of course the
Fairbairn Cup and the C.U.B.C. Lent Plate. The three-handled Mew Cup,
used for pouring Guinness over new boats, is there (front R).</p><p>Yet to be added were the Mitchell Cup, the Ladies Plate and the
Colquhoun Sculls. The gentleman in the left hand portrait behind us,
Lord Kelvin (perhaps the most prominent man of science since Newton),
won the Colquhouns handily in 1843 and kept in touch with the club long
after returning to Glasgow. He must have smiled down on Martin.</p><p>Our Rugby club was well represented and added to the number of boats we
had on the river that year. Good things, Rugby clubs &ndash; lots of
enthusiasm. Is it that flogging along a river backwards, and running
headlong into other people on a muddy field, both provide healthy escape
from books? Mens sana and all that? The gang must have been a poetic
lot, although that wasn&rsquo;t obvious at the time, witness the following,
reprinted with permission from David van Rest &lsquo;53.</p><p>In years to come when we perhaps are dead,</p><p><em>They'll laud</em>  this year when Peterhouse went head</p><p>Of Lents. Hearken then and listen well</p><p>To hear the story as the muses tell.</p><p> </p><p>Successive captains down to Hewlett and Leach</p><p>Had made the club a high position reach,</p><p>And then long Oxley well his men he <em>[led.]{.underline}</em></p><p>They made three worthy bumps and reached the head.</p><p>Much thanks to Taylor (coach). He knows the bumps</p><p>Between both boats and also metal lumps.</p><p> </p><p>The fates looked down on Peterhouse and let</p><p>Three boats make three bumps each and set</p><p>The muse to coach the Rugger boat. The bard</p><p>He rode the bank and made the crew go hard.</p><p>&ldquo;Spring is the time for courtship and for mating</p><p>And spring will also give a higher rating.&rdquo;</p><p> </p><p>Replied the lads of Peter&rsquo;s Rugger boat:-</p><p>We&rsquo;ll punch it through and forward gently float."</p><p>At first they missed, then faster plied the oar</p><p>And caught the men of Sydney Sussex four</p><p>Then Queens and Lady Margaret seventh crew.</p><p>The fates discussed and said that that would do.</p><p> </p><p>####### That night they drank much beer and wine as well</p><p>And praised the fates and later burnt a shell.</p><p>And mid the snow they yearned for summer days</p><p>And hoped they&rsquo;d bring success <em>in  Mays</em>.</p><p>Who was the bard? The rugger club have guessed</p><p>Behind this doubtful shield he liked to REST.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){if(window.getSelection().toString())return;e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#appendix-4-club-spirit----the-mitchell-cup-rugger-boats-and-such-matters>Appendix 4.
